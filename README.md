This is My general portfolio website, which I created as a task during my internship with Bharat Intern. Designed with the primary goal of providing a platform for deepening my skills in front-end development, specifically HTML and CSS. Skill Enhancement: Through the development of this portfolio, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS, including their best practices, coding conventions, and responsive design principles. Confidence Building: By working hands-on with these essential web development languages, I will not only acquire practical experience but also boost my confidence in tackling more complex coding challenges.
